Quality Checks
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script performs quality checks to validate the integrity, consistency,
    and accuracy of the Gold Layer. These checks ensure:
    - Uniqueness of surrogate keys in dimension views.
    - Referential integrity between fact and dimension views.
    - Validation of relationships in the data model for analytical purposes.

Usage Notes:
    - Run these checks after building the Gold layer views.
    - Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the checks.

Note:
    No MySQL-specific syntax changes were needed for this script — GROUP BY /
    HAVING duplicate checks and LEFT JOIN connectivity checks work identically
    to the original SQL Server version.

-- Check the data model connectivity between fact and dimension views
-- Expectation: No results (every fact row should match a valid customer
-- and product in the dimension views)
